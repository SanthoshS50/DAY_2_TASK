Write a blog on the Difference between Document and Window Objects :

In the JavaScript Document and Window Objects are Two Fundamental Objects used to intract with and Manipulate web pages.

They are part of the "Document Object Model"(DOM) and the Window objects respectively.

Document Object:

        The document object represents the HTML content of the current web page, and it provides access to the DOM tree of the page.

        It allows you to manipulate and interact with the structure and content of the web page,
        
        such as modifying elements, creating new elements, or changing the document's title.

        It is primarily used for working with the HTML structure, content, and layout of a web page.

Examples :

// Access an element by its ID
var element = document.getElementById('myElement');

// Change the text content of an element
element.textContent = 'New Text';

Window Object : 

        The window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded.

        It provides properties and methods for managing the browser window, such as controlling the size, position, and navigation.

        It also includes properties for handling events like 
        
            window.alert() for Alert Message, 
        
            window.location for managing the URL,
            
Examples :

// Open a new browser window
window.open('https://www.google.com');

// Display an alert dialog
window.alert('This is an alert message');
